# Problem Statement:
**Create a web app to store notes. Similar to slite/notion/confluence (or Evernote with multiple users accesing the same note)**. 

# Description:
Make a web app that will let users add/edit and share notes. The notes would have primarily text with some images and other embedded content and links.
The webapp has to be collaborative with multiple users being able to make changes.
